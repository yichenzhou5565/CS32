This Project is Game Kala. The highlight of this project is that we have to make the 
"smartPlayer (the computer player)" wins as much as they can. This is to say, we want 
to 'predict' which move is the best as accurate as possible. Here is a more detailed 
description: I used list and map as containers in this project. In the class Board, I 
used list from STL library to store and trace the number of beans in the holes as well 
as the pots. I made two lists of int’s, corresponding to the SOUTH and the NORTH side. 
For each list, the 0 position correspond to the pot, and the position starting from one 
has the same index with the hole’s number mentioned in the spec. For tracing and accessing 
purposes, I used iterator (and const_iterator when necessary…) to trace the each list. I 
defined two non-member functions in Side.h and gave implementations in main. I used map as 
well, which will be described more in detail in the documentation for SmartPlayer::chooseMove. 
The helper function generalMove basically does whatever the move() function in game should 
do (i.e., one complete move). I defined this function as a non-member function just because 
I want to use it in the SmartPlayer::chooseMove function to “make” the move, so that I can 
trace down what will happen (what is the best path) if we “make” the move. The second helper 
function is generalStatus, which basically does everything Game::status should do(determining 
if the game is over, if there is a winner, who is the winner, if any). I defined this non-member 
function because I want to decide the status of the game in SmartPlayer::chooseMove implementation 
as well. Note that it will speed up the code if we already know one side will win before the game 
is even officially over. For more detailed algorithm or pseudocode, please see report.
